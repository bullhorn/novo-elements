## Usage

<novo-grid columns="2" align="start" gap="2rem">
<div>

Avatars are images used to represent users and organizations. They typically are squares with rounded edges.

An avatar acts as a proxy for a user or entity (such as a company) in a product. They're often combined with status or presence indicators to give more context. Users generally upload their own image, otherwise, a default image is displayed

</div>

<img src="assets/images/AvatarOverview.png"/>

</novo-grid>

## Best Practices

- circular avatars to quickly identify people (users, contact)
- square avatars to help identify other entities like companies, jobs
