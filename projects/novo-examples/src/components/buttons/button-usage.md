### Why?

A button clearly indicates a point of action for the user. Bullhorn buttons come in a variety of themes, custom tailored to fit your use\-case.

Bullhorn button themes were hand crafted to make your life easier. Most buttons used in the Bullhorn platform should utilize a `theme` attribute. Theme attributes provide access to every variation of Bullhorn UX approved buttons. Depending on the theme, some buttons may also utilize `icon`, `side`, and `inverse` attributes. Button are divided by function into four main categories: Primary, Secondary, Neutralizing, Subtractive. There are also three other button types that are independent of function: Dialogue, Icon, and Header.
