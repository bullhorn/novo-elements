### Why?

Non-ideal UI states inform the user that some content is unavailable. There are several types of non-ideal states, including:

- **Empty state**: when a list has no data in it yet, or a container's contents have been intentionally removed.
- **Loading state**: when waiting for data to load, Best practice is to show a spinner for this state, with optional explanatory text below the spinner.
- **Error state**: its broken (for instance, 404 and 500 HTTP errors). In this case, best practice is to add a call to action directing the user what to do next.
