## Best Practices

- A number of components can be used to give people the ability to select options. See the list of related components below for advice on choosing the right one.
- When organizing dropdown menu items, sort the list in a logical order by putting the most selected option at the top, if known. Test and refine over time to re-evaluate if all menu items are needed.
- For long lists, group related menu items. If including radio buttons and checkboxes as menu items, try grouping related actions.
- Grouped items are separated by a short, uppercase title that describes the options in that sub-category.
