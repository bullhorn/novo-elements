Switches & Toggles [(source)](https://github.com/bullhorn/novo-elements/blob/master/projects/novo-elements/src/elements/switch)
========================================================================================================

Loading animations are used to help indicate to the user that some sort of progress is taking place. These are especially helpful for intensive operations that might take extra time.

Types
-----

##### Tiles

Similar to radio buttons, tiles are used to select a single item. Tiles have a higher visibility than radio buttons, and are used more frequently in data visualizations. Tiles stretch horizontally, so the list they pull from must be small.

##### Switches

Switches are a binary toggle that allow the user to select one of two options. They are most frequently used for an on\-off model.
