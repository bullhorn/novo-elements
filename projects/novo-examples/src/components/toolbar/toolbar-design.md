>
> **Sizes**
>
> A toolbar container can be `sm`, `md`, or `lg`, which can be set by the `size` property. This will affect the height and horizontal padding of the container. Toolbars should all be the same size or stacked in descending sizes.

> ![placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/350x200)
>
> **Dividers**
>
> Use `<novo-divider vertical>` to separate section in a toolbar row. Divider can be used to separate stacked toolbars but only when the toolbars are the same color.

> ![placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/350x200)
>
> **Branding/Title**
>
> Branding in general should be setup on the left side of the toolbar. Your toolbar should either have a title or branding but not both.  

> ![placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/350x200)
>
> **Menu or Icon**
>
> If you page has side navigation or a menu, than a menu icon can appear before the title or branding. If the toolbar doesn't need the `menu` icon, you may use and static icon to help add context to your title, but you should never have both.

> ![placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/350x200)
>
> **Tabs**
>
> Whether or not your toolbar needs top level nav, tabs should always be positioned to the right of the icon or branding.


> ![placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/350x200)
>
> **Search**
>
> You can include search functionality in your toolbar.
