## Anatomy

<novo-grid columns="2" align="start" gap="2rem">

<img src="assets/images/ModalAnatomy.png" width="450">

<div>

1. **Container**<br>
   Tabs consist of a title that is descriptive of the information it holds. The currently selected tab is indicated by a colored bar that sits either below or left of the title (depending on the configuration). When the amount of tabs doesn't fit in the given space, a dropdown labeled More is added to the far right side of the tab bar. This dropdown contains all the overflowing tabs.

1. **Active Indicator**<br>
   This is the visual symbol that represents which tab is currently active or being viewed.

1. **Leading Icon (Optional)**<br>
   Should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, primarily used for mobile or responsive design

1. **Trailing Icon (Optional)**<br>
   Should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, primarily used to display status to user

</div>
</novo-grid>

## Best Practices

- Tab labels should provide clear and concise descriptions of the content within
  Avoid having more than 2 words unless the name of a product or entity prevents this.

- Tab contents should be categorically independent from the content of other tabs, so the user is not confused by where information might be.

## Color

> > **Theme - background**
> >
> > Any theme color can be applied to tabs which will make the background color match the color.
> > Any theme color can be applied to tabs with the `color` attribute to change the text color

> > **Regular tabs**

> > The currently selected tab is indicated by the blue title and the blue bar that sits below or left of the title. The other tabs are using a grey font.

> > When tabs are used on a colored background, e.g. on a slide out, the currently selected tab is indicated by the white title and the white bar that sits below or left of the title. The other tabs are using a white font with a 70% opacity, leaving the background color to shine through.

## Patterns

<novo-grid columns="2" align="start" gap="2rem">

> **Tab with Status**
>
> When displaying a status for tab to the user add a trailing icon to that tab. eg. if the tab has an error state use a trailing icon[color=negative] for that tab.

## Accessibility

- When implementing logic to update which tab item is active be sure to account for triggering the state on click, touch, and keyboard interactions.
- `<novo-tabs>` should include the aria `tablist` role and novo-tab should include the aria tab role.
- If used for page navigation then novo-tabs should include the aria `nav` role
