      The Highland (Scottish Gaelic: Bò Ghàidhealach; Scots: Hielan coo) is a Scottish breed of rustic cattle. It
      originated in the <novo-link>Scottish Highlands</novo-link> and the Outer Hebrides islands of Scotland and has
      long horns and a long shaggy coat. It is a hardy breed, bred to withstand the intemperate conditions in the
      region. The first herd-book dates from 1885; two different types - a smaller island type, usually black, and a
      larger mainland type, usually dun - were registered as a single breed. It is reared primarily for beef, and has
      been exported to several other countries.<sup>[1]</sup>
