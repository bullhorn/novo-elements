ðŸ“¢  --Release month TBD-- (version 9)
===========================

**CommonJS library removal**: Version 9 continues to remove some of the dependence on CommonJS libraries. The previous release deprecated Dragula, as well as some of our date-fns. This release has a new target.

**Ace Editor removal / Code Editor**: In V9, we have deprecated the `novo-ace-editor` component, and its reliance on the Ace Editor. It is being replaced with `novo-code-editor`, implemented using the [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) library.
