===========================

# Continuing CommonJS library removal
The previous release of novo-elements, version 8, started to deprecate some modules that relied on CommonJS libraries. In version 9, we are introducing some new options to replace the tools that we've removed.

## NovoDragDrop
While there are several third-party options to replace Dragula (deprecated in v8), our drag-and-drop utility, such as [cdkDrag](https://v7.material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview) and [ngx-drag-drop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-drag-drop), we are also adding the [`NovoDragDropModule`](https://bullhorn.github.io/novo-elements/docs/#/utils/drag%20and%20drop), which provides drag and drop capability with support for grid layouts. We have also added an example page to demonstrate its usage.

We recommend that users switch from the dragula directive to novoDragDrop, cdkDrag, or a third-party solution in anticipation of future optimization strategies.

## Code Editor
In version 8, we deprecated Ace Editor. This module has not been removed yet, but there is now a recommended option to replace it: [The Novo Code Editor](https://bullhorn.github.io/novo-elements/docs/#/utils/code%20editor), backed by [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net/). This supports basic syntax highlighting for JavaScript.

## Text masks
`angular2-text-mask`, a CommonJS dependency used for text masking support, has been exchanged for `imask`. This may affect the arguments provided to `maskOptions.mask` in the `TextBoxControl` type. The [Form example](https://bullhorn.github.io/novo-elements/docs/#/form-controls/form) has been updated with a "hexadecimal" field to showcase its use. Further examples can be found on [imask's documentation page](https://imask.js.org/guide.html#masked-base).

# Peer Dependencies

The following peer dependencies have been *removed* from novo-elements. If your core project does not use them, they can be safely removed.
- text-mask-addons

The following peer dependencies have been *added* to support the novo-code-editor.
- @codemirror/commands
- @codemirror/state
- @codemirror/view

Lastly, the `timezone-support` module has been upgraded from 2.0.2 to 3.1.0.
