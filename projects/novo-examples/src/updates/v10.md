🎉 April 2024 (version 10)
===========================

**Announcement**: Novo Elements is now on Angular 17!

This brings Novo Elements up to the latest versions of both Angular and Typescript. We have also removed the long-since deprecated Table component and Dragula add-on. 

## Upgrading to v10
- You may need to update your node version as Angular 17 requires at least `^18.13.0` or `^20.9.0`.
- If your application is using the Novo Elements `dragula` add-on, you will need to refactor it using the guide below.
- If your application is still using the Novo Elements `table` component, you will need to refactor it to use the `novo-data-table` component.

## Dragula
There are a few options for Novo Elements users who wish to use drag and drop functionality on our components.

For basic new implementations we recommend our new lightweight [drag-drop component](https://bullhorn.github.io/novo-elements/docs/#/utils/drag%20and%20drop) which should handle most simple use cases going forward.

If you have more advanced needs or are refactoring a component that is currently using the previous Novo Elements dragula add-on directive and service, we recommend switching over to use the [ng2-dragula](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-dragula) library. This was forked from the same library we originally forked @bullhorn/dragula from, but has been receiving consistent updates for the past 6 years (while ours hasn't), and has its own directive and service which function almost identically to our Novo Elements add-on directive and service which were just removed. Some key differences if you're going this route:

- NovoDragulaModule, NovoDragulaService imports from 'novo-elements' will now be DragulaModule, DragulaService imports from 'ng2-dragula'
- add DragulaModule.forRoot() to your app module imports
- NovoDragulaService.setOptions() calls will now be DragulaService.createGroup()
- NovoDragulaService events will now be function calls - ie NovoDragulaService.drop.subscribe() is now DragulaService.drop().subscribe()
- the return values from these events are no longer arrays with specific properties at certain indexes, but are now objects with defined properties
- some CSS additions may be necessary, either by importing an ng2-dragula stylesheet or adding the styles manually (see readme link below)
- the dragulaModel input will no longer mutate the array you pass in, but return a new array with the changes, so you will want to use two-way data binding in your templates for this
- as of 4/24 there is a bug in the current ng2-dragula npm 5.0.1-5.0.2 releases around the required peer dependency angular versions, so you may need to override these in your package.json until it's fixed

Other changes which may be relevant (such as the css changes) may be listed in the [ng2-dragula readme](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-dragula/tree/master). Event return values and other changes can be discerned from the [ng2-dragula DragulaService file](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-dragula/blob/master/libs/ng2-dragula/src/components/dragula.service.ts).
