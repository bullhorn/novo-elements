**Announcement**: Novo Elements is being updated to Angular 13

Bullhorn is continually seeking to update and innovate our products, and leverage the latest features in the frameworks we use. In support of that mission, we are updating our Novo UI and its supporting novo-elements library to Angular 13.  This update  allows us to continue offering a streamlined and consistent experience across Bullhornâ€™s complete product portfolio.  This update includes both an Angular upgrade, as well as supporting the latest Typescript updates.  You can find more details in the Technical Release Notes section below.

## Release Timeline

Bullhorn has released a Release Candidate v7 of Novo-elements. Bullhorn will update Novo to use Novo-Elements v7 in the 2022.6 release

```sh
npm install novo-elements@next
# or
npm install novo-elements@7.2.0-next.0
```

## Upgrading to V7

ðŸ“¢  June 2022 (version 7.2.x)
===========================

**New Feature: Query Builder**: We have added a new component to help with building complex and modern interfaces.  At Bullhorn we have to enable our users to create advanced and dynamic searches against their data.  We have built many iterations of a query builder in the past but we think this one is our best and most re-usable.

### Autocomplete [#](https://bullhorn.github.io/novo-elements/docs/#/updates/v7dot3#autocomplete){#autocomplete}

Autocomplete now works with the NovoChipList when used in a NovoFormField.  The manual events are no longer necessary to utilize the autocomplete functionality.  Now basic functionality can be supported with a limited specification.

```html
<novo-field>
  <novo-label>Favorite Fruits</novo-label>
  <novo-chip-list #chipList [formControl]="fieldCtrl">
    <novo-chip *ngFor="let fruit of chipList.value" [value]="fruit">
      <novo-text>fruit</novo-text>
      <novo-icon novoChipRemove>close</novo-icon>
    </novo-chip>
    <input #chipInput novoChipInput placeholder="New fruit..." autocomplete="off" [formControl]="searchCtrl" />
  </novo-chip-list>
  <novo-autocomplete (optionSelected)="selected($event)" multiple>
    <novo-option *ngFor="let fruit of filteredFruits | async" [value]="fruit">
      fruit
    </novo-option>
  </novo-autocomplete>
</novo-field>
```

### Loading Pattern for Non Ideal State [#](https://bullhorn.github.io/novo-elements/docs/#/updates/v7dot3#loading-pattern){#loading-pattern}

Adding a message next to the novo-loading component is not a known pattern. This could be used to display a message while loading with the flag controlled at implementation. This can be used for a loading message displaying all the time for a loading screen, or having a timer flipping the flag to show a message during a long long loading screen.

Also added the ability for the FieldInteractionAPI to update the description of a field (potentially adding in HTML):

```typescript
API.setDescription('description', '<span><b>BOLD</b> description with a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> Link</span>');
```
