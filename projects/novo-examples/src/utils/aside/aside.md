# Asides [(source)](https://github.com/bullhorn/novo-elements/blob/master/projects/novo-elements/src/elements/aside)

Asides are pop\-up dialogues designed to grab attention and inform the user of something critical, force a decision, or extend a workflow. There are two categories of modals: notification and workflow. Regardless of type, a modal should have a maximum of two main buttons.

## Examples

##### Custom

In the case where "Success", "Warning", and "Error" notfications aren't enough, use the custom notification. Custom notifcations allow any of the Bullhorn Icons to be used in the notification.

##### Add

Add modals have a colored title bar based on the record type being created. Additionally, due to a greater than average amount of content, they have fixed footers.
