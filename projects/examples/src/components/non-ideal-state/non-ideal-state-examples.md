## Basic Usage

Basic use-case is to display an icon, message, and reason for this state to occur. And provide a call to action for the user.

<code-example example="non-ideal-state-usage"></code-example>

The call to action doesn't necessarily need to be a button, for example:

<code-example example="non-ideal-state-search-usage"></code-example>
<code-example example="non-ideal-state-loading-usage"></code-example>
