## Customizing Labels

With Novo Elements there are a few hard coded labels throughout the library. To override these labels with your own, you will simply extend the `NovoLabelService` and override any labels that you wish.

To make Angular2 use this new class over the default one you can provide in the bootstrapping of your application as a provider.

```
{ provide: NovoLabelService, useClass: MyLabelService }
```

To use the default labels, you will need to provide the `NOVO_ELEMENTS_LABELS_PROVIDERS` via

```
import {NOVO_ELEMENTS_LABELS_PROVIDERS} from 'novo-elements';
bootstrap(MyApp [..NOVO_ELEMENTS_LABELS_PROVIDERS]);
```
