      Fezzik was employed by Vizzini. He doesn't have a problem with subverting the law, but doesn't like to fight dirty. He is
      friends with Inigo; the two like to play rhyming games with one another from time-to-time at the ire of their employer.
      Fezzik is very tall and big so at a very young age, his parents made him fight competitively.
